*there are strange marks all over the place, on all kinds of surfaces...*
### strange marks 

[rahil's notepad](https://rahilpatel.com), my first web-site, since circa 2005(?)  
  - [my "resume"](https://rahilpatel.com/resume), more like a history of my life
  - [my early portfolio](https://rahilpatel.com/portfolio), lists my early digital works and my early writings; extremely limited given i haven't done much digital work nor even much writing for many years now
  - [things i've written](https://rahilptel.com/blog/things-ive-written), some of my early writings 'n philosophies

future projects:  
[rathewolf](https://rathewolf.com] (this site!), my new digital home
  - [the mind of rathewolf](https://mind.rathewolf.com), a new digital home for my philosophies, my language: my mind  
    - [todo: mind, heart, soul; are they all the same? not really... the mind is more thinking, the soul is more moving, and the heart is more loving.]
  - the body of rathewolf, a digital home for my photos 'n videos
  - the heart of rathewolf, a digital home for my most beloved things (perhaps like my personal wall of photos: people and places)
  - the soul of rathewolf, a digital home for the things that move my soul (???, art works?: poetry, Humans of Taiwan, documentaries, the streets, the world)

[willowolf](https://willowolf.com), my wills; paths, directions, *desires*
  - [the way of fighting games: a willowolf](https://willowolf.com/fga), a digital community space focused on fighting games  
  - [the way of experimental games: a willowolf](https://willowolf.com/ega), a digital community space focused on experimental games  
  - [the way of nature's guardian: a willowolf](https://willowolf.com/nga), a digital community space focused on the true way to live: with nature, slowly, uncivilized
