### notes
maybe should just include the portfolio here, so everything is on one page


### first section of my old web-site
Herro. I'm Rahil. And this is my digital room.

It&#8217;s kinda like my actual bed-room: an organized mess. On this site you can see [things I&#8217;ve made](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/portfolio), [organized things I&#8217;ve written](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written).

On this page, you can see what I try to do, how I try to do them, and what I like or like to do.
