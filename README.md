# rathewolf
my new digital home!

![](docs/assets/images/expressionless.jpg?raw=true)

my old site can still be spotted at www.rahilpatel.com

although this domain (rathewolf.com) contains a bunch of other web-sites for my digital projects, *this* site (www.rathewolf.com), merely serves as a site map to them.

it also contains a list of my digital works: my "portfolio". The problem with that though is that it doesn't contain the other 95% of my life, which was and is lived beyond this screen. [todo:] Perhaps a bio / history is needed.

www.rathewolf.com is reserved for *personal* digital works: my portfolio will contain most of them, while bigger projects, such as my writing project, will have it's own site (on a sub-domain)

www.willowolf.com is reserved for *public* digital works intended for *the people*: digital community organizations / directions (and their tools: Discord, Disqus, etc.), public digital tools (apps), etc. Communities begin on a sub-domain. If it grows, creates it's own identity, it can be moved later.

www.wolfoftheway.com is reserved... for the heck of it!

# notes
can keep notes that affect all of the sub-domain sites here

naming:
mind, heart, soul; are they all the same? not really... the mind is more thinking, the soul is more moving, and the heart is more loving. The soul is the life or the spirit of a person.]


style:
the style of this site is akin to a generic youthful protagonist character from a JRPG, the voice at least... The colors 'n art shuold be colorful vector art, made with a tablet: bold outlines, bold colors, simple.

   - this simple site's style is cute! :)

todo: 

todo:  
just a fraction of projects 'n ideas:  
rathewolf
  - the mind of rathewolf
    - no folders, all in one folder, sorted by date
    - edited / complete writings category
    - writings category
    - thoughts category
    - ideas category
  - **the body of rathewolf, a digital home for my photos 'n videos**
  - the heart of rathewolf, a digital home for my most beloved things (perhaps like my personal wall of photos: people and places)
  - the soul of rathewolf, a digital home for the things that move my soul (???, art works?: poetry, Humans of Taiwan, documentaries, the streets, the world
  - rahil's notepad, a copy of my old site, but on this domain
  - notepad (working title), a digital home for my notes files (very much like github's gists, note on *everything*, different from my more meaningful philosophical writings, more public-oriented, and should be separate from my more serious 'mind of rathewolf')
    - make a parser for my original notes syntax (that i've used since i was a child), now that's a pretty cool project! :), jekyll provides a way, but maybe can also write a tiny haXe script for general use!

willowolf
  - philosowolf, philosophy generally against civilization, toward nature, toward the feminine...
  - gorge's guardians
    - **most of my focus should be on projects for these people*

games  
*note to self: forget the traditional style of making video games and stick to making input interfaces to existing games, and modifying existing games, or combining them? who knows! go back to creative frameworks!! The game engine world is a deep deep rabbit hole! :(*

#### markdown notes
new lines suck\
are backslashes at the end of the line really not a good idea?
really just need to create my own mark-up language...  
ugh!
