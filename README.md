# rathewolf
my new digital home!

![](docs/assets/images/expressionless.jpg?raw=true)

my old site can still be spotted at www.rahilpatel.com

although this site (rathewolf.com) contains a bunch of other web-sites for my digital projects, *this* site, www.., merely serves as a site map to them.

it also contains a list of my digital works: my "portfolio". The problem with that though is that it doesn't contain the other 95% of my life, which was and is lived beyond this screen. [todo:] Perhaps a bio / history is needed.

www.rathewolf.com is reserved for *personal* digital works: my portfolio will contain most of them, while bigger projects, such as my writing project, will have it's own site (on a sub-domain)

www.willowolf.com is reserved for public digital works intended for *the people*: digital community organizations / directions (and their tools: Discord, Disqus, etc.), public digital tools (apps), etc. Communities begin on a sub-domain. If it grows, creates it's own identity, it can be moved later.

www.wolfoftheway.com is reserved... for the heck of it!

# notes
can keep notes that affect all of the sub-domain sites here

naming:
mind, heart, soul; are they all the same? not really... the mind is more thinking, the soul is more moving, and the heart is more loving. The soul is the life or the spirit of a person.]


style:
the style of this site is akin to a generic youthful protagonist character from a JRPG, the voice at least... The colors 'n art shuold be colorful vector art, made with a tablet: bold outlines, bold colors, simple.

todo:

#### markdown notes
new lines suck\
are backslashes at the end of the line really not a good idea?
really just need to create my own mark-up language...  
ugh!
