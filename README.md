welcome to...
# rathewolf
my new digital home!

my old site can still be spotted at www.rahilpatel.com

although this site (rathewolf.com) contains a bunch of other web-sites for my digital projects, *this* site, www.., merely serves as a site map to them.

it also contains a list of my digital works: my "portfolio". The problem with that though is that it doesn't contain the other 95% of my life, which was and is lived beyond this screen. [todo:] Perhaps a bio / history is needed.

www.rathewolf.com is reserved for *personal* digital works: my portfolio will contain most of them, while bigger projects, such as my writing project, will have it's own site (on a sub-domain)

www.willowolf.com is reserved for public digital works intended for *the people*: digital community organizations / directions (and their tools: Discord, Disqus, etc.), public digital tools (apps), etc. Communities begin on a sub-domain. If it grows, creates it's own identity, it can be moved later.

www.wolfoftheway.com is reserved... for the heck of it!

# notes
can keep notes that affect all of the sub-domain sites here

#### markdown notes
new lines suck\
are backslashes at the end of the line really not a good idea?
really just need to create my own mark-up language...  
ugh!
